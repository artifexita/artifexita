- 👋 Hi, I’m @artifexus aka Richard West.
- 👀 I’m interested in Designing the right thing & Designing things right using Systems and Design Thinking in a truly Agile manner.
Oh, and I also have a 30+ years in IT, mostly contracting as an Architect, Developer and Agile coach.
I have never stopped learning which is why my skills cover a bit of ground.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and AI.
- 💞️ I’m not yet looking to collaborate on anything yet, but feel free to say hello 🙂
- 💰 Although I'm working on something in stealth at the moment, I will do some consulting if it's intersting enough and I can do it part time.
It should be short term (few months) and with organisations who are open to new and creative ideas and approaches, preferably using AI which I've been
working with for the past year.
- 📫 Ping me for some contact details or connect on LinkedIn: https://au.linkedin.com/in/rwest
